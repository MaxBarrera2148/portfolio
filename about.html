       <h1 >  About Me.</h1>       
       <p>I grew up in New England (I’m still a loyal Patriots fan) and now live in Cancún, Mexico, where I split my time between building websites, exploring new technologies, and enjoying life near the beach.</p>
       <br>
       <p>I’ve always been fascinated by how design, performance, and data come together to solve real problems. Whether I’m improving site speed, refining a user journey, or testing something new in the code, I enjoy the process of making things work better — step by step, iteration by iteration.</p>  
       <br>
       <p>Outside of work, I like snorkeling, visiting Mayan ruins, and exploring the jungles of the Yucatán with my family. I’ve found that curiosity drives everything I do — it’s what got me into web development, and it’s what keeps me learning and experimenting every day.</p>
